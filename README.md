## Netflix EDA & ML

Project Objectives: 
  - Build a model which will recommend relevant shows and movies
  - Complete EDA on:
    - Most common genres - TV Shows & Movies
    - Most common decription terms - TV Shows & Movies
    - Commonly appearing actors - Movies, NOT for TV Shows (Reasoning provided in notebook)
    - Most common ratings - TV Shows & Movies
  
The project's focus is to use Netflix's data on movies and shows on their platform.

This project will allow me to develop further knowledge in ML, primarily NLP.

Main libraries used in this project:
  - NLTK
  - SkLearn
  - WordCloud
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib

Well labelled/commented for easy-to-understand future reference. 

** RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHM NOT COMPLETE - ACTIVELY WORKING TOWARDS CREATING THE MOST ACCURATE MODEL **
