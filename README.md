# Netflix EDA & ML

The project's focus is to use data gathered from Netflix, to go and predict relevant movies or shows.
  - E.g.: You watch "Goodfellas", what other movies or shows would the viewer like to see, relative to what they already watch.
  
This project will allow me to develop further knowledge in ML, primary NLP - where I use libraries such as NLTK for the end prediction model and for EDA on content within different countries or continents.
